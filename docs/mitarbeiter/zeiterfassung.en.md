## Timer

### Shortcut keys for the timer

You can also control the timer using the keyboard. This works with these keyboard shortcuts:

- **Start**: `s`
- **Pause**: `p`
- **Continue**: `s`
- **Stop**: `e`

The form in the modal dialog can be submitted using the keyboard shortcut `Ctrl + Enter` (`Command + Enter` on Mac). 
This allows times to be recorded very quickly, even without a mouse.

### Record times for other people

It often happens that there are two people in a meeting with a customer. If both people leave the timer running, 
it often happens that the two bookings have slightly different start and stop times. This is not so nice on a 
timesheet that the customer later receives.

In this case, it makes sense if only one person runs the timer and records the times for both people. 
So that both bookings have the same start and stop times.

If you select a project in the modal dialog for time recording that has several active members, another input field 
appears for the participants. Here you can then select the participants for whom you want to record the time.
The autocomplete suggests the usernames of the active members. You can also add multiple participants here. 
Here's an example, where Max Mustermann was added.

![Add participant](../img/context-employee/participants-01-en.png)

If you book the time now, the time will be recorded for both people. Two bookings will then be created, 
one for you and one for Max Mustermann. Both bookings have exactly the same content. 
It looks very professional on a timesheet if the times of the meeting participants all have the same start and stop times.

## FAQs

### Why are bookings no longer editable after a certain time?

In ZEIT.IO, all employee bookings have a so-called "Freeze Time". This means that bookings are no longer editable 
after a certain time. The "Freeze Time" is set to 30 days by default. This means that bookings that are older than 
30 days can no longer be edited. This is to protect the employer. For controlling purposes and for billing, it is 
important that bookings can no longer be changed.

The "Freeze Time" can be configured per contract. This means that each employee can have a different "Freeze Time".
If you want to edit bookings after a certain time, please contact your supervisor or the HR department. They can
adjust the "Freeze Time" for your contract.
