### Why are bookings no longer editable after a certain time?

In ZEIT.IO, all employee bookings have a so-called "Freeze Time". This means that bookings are no longer editable 
after a certain time. The "Freeze Time" is set to 30 days by default. This means that bookings that are older than 
30 days can no longer be edited. This is to protect the employer. For controlling purposes and for billing, it is 
important that bookings can no longer be changed.

The "Freeze Time" can be configured per contract. This means that each employee can have a different "Freeze Time".
If you want to edit bookings after a certain time, please contact your supervisor or the HR department. They can
adjust the "Freeze Time" for your contract.
