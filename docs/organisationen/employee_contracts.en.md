### How can I allow half vacation days for an employee?

From a legal point of view, there are no half vacation days in Germany, as this would contradict the principle of relaxation.
Nevertheless, it is possible for employers and employees to agree in the employment contract to grant half vacation days.
In ZEIT.IO, you can activate the option for half vacation days in the contract conditions of your employee.
To do this, please navigate, in the context of the organization, to the desired employee contract and click on the
"Settings" tab. In the "Vacation" section, there is a checkbox "Half vacation days are possible". If this option is
activated, then the employee can apply for half vacation days.
