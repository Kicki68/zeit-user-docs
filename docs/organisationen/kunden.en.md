## Departments

Of course, large customers also have several departments. Each department is responsible for a specific matter.
Quite often there is, for example, a purchasing department, an accounting department, a finance department, and so on. 
departments usually also have a unique name, their own email list and their own telephone number/fax-number.

Accordingly, you can also map your customers’ departments in ZEIT.IO. For projects and invoices
You can then also select the department when assigning the customer. This can influence the
billing address and the recipient email address.

To create a department, please navigate to the desired customer and then click on the left side menu
on “Departments”. Here you can see the list of all existing departments and here you can also create a new one. 
To do this, please click on the “Create new department” button. The form will then appear
like this:

![Departments](../img/context-organization/cust-dep-01-en.png)

Here you can then enter the name of the department, the email address and the telephone number/fax number.

With the first checkbox you can control whether the name of the department should be used in invoices.
If the checkbox is not active, the name of the department will not appear in invoices.
If the checkbox is activated, then the name of the department will appear in invoices as a separate line below
of the customer name. This can be very important to ensure that the invoice is sent to you
correct department is delivered.

You can also use the last two checkboxes to determine whether this department is an invoice recipient,
or is a reminder recipient.
