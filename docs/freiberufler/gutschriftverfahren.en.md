# Credit note procedure

If you book times and expenses on a project that belongs to an organization, then there recorded items
need to be checked and approved in an approval process. ZEIT.IO ensures
that only approved times and expenses can be invoiced. A very popular alternative to invoices is 
the credit note procedure.

!!! Info
    The credit note procedure is a special way of billing for deliveries and services between a customer and his 
    supplier, where the billing burden does not lie with the supplier, but with the customer himself. 
    **Simply put, a credit note is a reverse invoice and is issued for approved services.**

## How does the credit note process work?

After you have booked your time and/or expenses for a project, you request approval for it. 
If your submitted timesheet (or expense) is approved, a credit note will be issued automatically. 
The credit note is issued by the organization running the project.
The credit note contains the same information as an invoice, except that the billing burden is borne by the 
organization rather than you.

You can then record the credit in your accounting, just as you would with an invoice.
Or you can pass the credit directly on to your tax advisor.
You then no longer have to write and send an invoice yourself.
