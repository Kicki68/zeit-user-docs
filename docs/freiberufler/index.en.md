# Freelancer context 

ZEIT.IO is multi-client capable and also has different contexts for different user groups.
The freelance context is a special context intended for freelancers and self-employed people.
If you register with ZEIT.IO as an individual, we assume that you are a freelancer,
or are self-employed and you will automatically be entered into the freelance context.

In a freelance context you can:

- Create and manage customers
- Create and manage projects
- Record project times
- Record expenses
- Create and send invoices
- Accept contract offers from ZEIT.IO organizations
- Request approval for recorded times and expenses

These features allow you to organize and manage your business as a freelancer or self-employed person.

!!! info
    Collaboration features are not included in this context. If you have employees yourself
    or manage freelancers yourself and want to work on projects together with other people, then
    you must register as a company and create the company as an organization. 
    As a freelancer, you can create a ZEIT.IO organization, at any time. 
    Take a look at the documentation for the organizational context.

If you have been invited to ZEIT.IO by an organization, then please take a look at the documentation
