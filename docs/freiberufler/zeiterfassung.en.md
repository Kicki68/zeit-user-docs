# Time tracking 

Time recording is an elementary function in ZEIT.IO. There are several ways you can track your project times:

- **Timer**: Track your times with the timer, with start, stop and break times.
- **Calendar**: Record your times in the calendar using “drag & drop”.
- **Hourly form**: Record your times manually by duration (hours & minutes), without start and stop time.
- **Daily form**: Record your times on a daily basis, without start and stop times.
- **Import**: Import your times from another system.

There are also various clients you can use to record your times:

- **WebApp**: Record your times in the web browser on the [ZEIT.IO page](https://zeit.io/en/).
- **Browser extension**: Record your times independently from the ZEIT.IO page, with the ZEIT.IO browser extension.
- **Mobile**: Record your times on your smartphone.
